# Part 3

We have implemented two important functions for robot localization. Sense gains new information and increases certainty of robot's localization. Move loses information increasing uncertainty of robot's localization. So both should be alternatively and accordingly used for successful navigation of robots.

Note when we say sense or move, we only update probability distribution given robot's capability for sense and motion. We did not operate robot directly yet.

That said, let us again re imagine our 1 D world again. Note also, we assume U = 1, that is, robot moving 1 cell at a time.

Suppose,
1. Robot senses 'red'
2. Move one step to right
3. Robot senses 'green'

What would be its current location intuitively? By looking at the map, we could say, its X<sub>4</sub>. But how could robot with all its sense and move inaccuracies fare in detecting that location? Let us calculate the resultant probability distribution.

```python
#Just for visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
def output_map(grid):
"""
outputs a bar chart showing the probabilities of each grid space
"""
x_labels = []
for index in range(len(grid)):
x_labels.append(index)
plt.bar(x_labels, grid)

<h1>Create names on the axes</h1>

plt.title('Probability of the robot being at each space on the grid')
plt.xlabel('1D Space')
plt.ylabel('Probability')
plt.show(block=True)

#initial probability
p=[0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]

#sense
world=['green', 'red', 'red', 'green', 'green']
pHit = 0.6
pMiss = 0.2

#move
pExact = 0.8
pOvershoot = 0.1
pUndershoot = 0.1

#our operation
print("Prior probability: " + str(p))
p = sense(p, 'red')
p = move(p , 1)
p = sense(p , 'green')
print("Posterior probability: " + str(p))
output_map(p)
```

Output:

I have also included a visualization, so the result is obvious.
